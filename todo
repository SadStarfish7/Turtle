Issues :

Chunk size depends on size of screen

When Screen dimesions as defined in main are non-final, Tile and chunk loading break, 
thus making implemnation of dynamic screen size impossible 

Cannot load multiple chunks cannot be loaded at the same time making smooth transitions impossible,
and heavily confilcts with any multiplayer implementation
